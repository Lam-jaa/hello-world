# hello-world
Starting my github repository.

Hi everyone,
Lamia here. Im jsut following the starting guide to learn how to use github. I can't believe it took me that long to use github.
I love eating food. So if you wanna please just bring me food, althought I hate goat cheese so don't give me goat cheese.
